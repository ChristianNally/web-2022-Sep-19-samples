### Primary Keys
* used to uniquely identify a record in a table
* they can be any data type
* compound keys

### Naming Conventions
* primary keys should always be `id`
* foreign keys should the other table's name singular plus `_id` (user_id, video_id)
* all table names are lowercase and plural

### Data Types
* major concern 10+ years ago
* they set aside space even if the value is null
* postal code => string H0H 0H0 90210 1234
* phone number => string

### Relationship Types
* one-to-one - one record in the first table is related to only one record in the second
* one-to-many/many-to-one - one record in the first table is related to one or more records in the second
* many-to-many - one or more records in the first table are related to one or more records in the second
